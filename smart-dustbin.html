    <p>This project uses Arduino uno, ultrasonic sensor, servomotor, green LED, Red LED, Buzzer, breadboard and connecting wires </p>
    <p>the algorithm of this working model is arduino uno connecting with ultrasonic sensor, servomotor, RFID-RC522, green LED, Red Led , Buzzer when any object comes in within range of one meter of  ultrasonic sensor servomotor ratates resulting opening the panel of bin and buzzer sounds beep beep and red led Blinks and when on one comes in range green led glows this helps to mantain clean sorrounding without physical touching the bin</p>
